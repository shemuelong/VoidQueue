# VoidQueue
Basic demonstration of a Queue of void pointers.

Instead of having a Queue of ints or strings, we have a queue of void pointers, which can support enqueueing and dequeueing of strings, integers, and doubles. 

The code for the Queue was taken from Clifford A Shaffer's Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis textbook. 
Certain functions and member variables were altered to implement a Queue of void pointers.

Overall a fun exercise, as we can very very easily begin referencing things that we shouldn't.

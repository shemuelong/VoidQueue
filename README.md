# VoidQueue
Basic demonstration of a Queue of void pointers.

Instead of having a Queue of ints or strings, we have a queue of void pointers, which can support enqueueing and dequeueing of strings, integers, and doubles. 

Overall a fun exercise, as we can very very easily begin referencing things that we shouldn't.
